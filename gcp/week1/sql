Joining yellow taxi table with the zones lookuo table (implicit join)
t is alias for the table
SELECT
tpep_pickup_datetime,
tpep_dropoff_datetime,
total_amount,
CONCAT (zpu."Borough", '/',zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
CONCAT (zdo."Borough", '/',zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t,
zones zpu,
zones zdo
WHERE
t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" AND
t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 10;

1.Using explicit inner join
SELECT
tpep_pickup_datetime,
tpep_dropoff_datetime,
total_amount,
CONCAT (zpu."Borough", '/',zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
CONCAT (zdo."Borough", '/',zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t JOIN zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
JOIN zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 10;

2.Checking for records with LocationID not in thr zones table
SELECT
tpep_pickup_datetime,
tpep_dropoff_datetime,
total_amount,
"PULocationID",
"DOLocationID"
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t
WHERE
"PULocationID" is NULL
LIMIT 100;

3.Checking for Location IDs in the zones table not in the yellow taxi table
SELECT
tpep_pickup_datetime,
tpep_dropoff_datetime,
total_amount,
"PULocationID",
"DOLocationID"
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t
WHERE
"PULocationID" NOT IN (SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones)
LIMIT 100;

4.Using Left, Right, and Outer Joins when some LocationIDs are not in either tables

5. Using GROUP BY to calculate number of trips per day
SELECT
  CAST (tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
  COUNT (1)
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
  CAST (tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)

6. Using ORDER BY to order the results of your query
SELECT
  CAST (tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
  COUNT (1)
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
  CAST (tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "day" ASC;

7. Other kinds of aggregations
SELECT
  CAST (tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
  COUNT (1) AS "count",
  MAX (total_amount),
  MAX (passenger_count)
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
  CAST (tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "count" DESC;

8. Grouping by multiple fields
SELECT
  CAST (tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
  "DOLocationID",
  COUNT (1) AS "count",
  MAX (total_amount),
  MAX (passenger_count)
FROM
yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
  1,2
ORDER BY
"day" ASC,
"DOLocationID" ASC;
